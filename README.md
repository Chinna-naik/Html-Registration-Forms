✨ Student Registration Form using HTML ✨

I'm happy to share my latest hands-on project: a Student Registration Form designed using pure HTML. This beginner-level project helped me strengthen my basics and understand how form elements work in real-time applications like admissions and online enrollments.

📝 What is this Project About?
I’ve created a structured HTML-based Student Registration Form that collects all the essential information of a student in a clean and user-friendly layout.
The form is built using a <form> inside a <table> for proper alignment and spacing.

📌 Key Features:
🍀 Roll Number Input
👉 Text field to enter student’s roll number.
✨ Used: <input type="text" required autofocus>

🍀 Student Name
👉 Two fields for First Name and Last Name to keep entries clear.
✨ Placeholder makes it user-friendly.

🍀 Father’s Name
👉 Basic text field with required validation.

🍀 Date of Birth
👉 Split into Day, Month, Year inputs with placeholders for better formatting.
✨ Not one calendar, but three separate fields for better clarity.

🍀 Mobile Number
👉 Two fields: One for the country code (+91) and one for the actual number.
✨ Helps in better mobile input control.

🍀 Password Field
👉 Secured using <input type="password">. Keeps the password hidden when typed.

🍀 Gender Selection
👉 Using Radio Buttons to choose between Male and Female.
✨ Only one option can be selected.

🍀 Department Selection
👉 Using Checkboxes to allow choosing one or more departments like CSE, ECE, Civil, etc.
✨ Gives flexibility to the user.

🍀 State Dropdown
👉 Organized using <optgroup> to group Indian states by region (North, South, East, West, Central, North-East).
✨ Helps in better UI and faster selection.

🍀 File Upload for Student Photo
👉 Accepts .jpg or .jpeg format only.
✨ Uses accept attribute to restrict file types.

🍀 City & Address Fields
👉 Input for city and a larger text area for complete address.

🍀 Buttons – Submit and Reset
👉 Submit button to register, and reset button to clear the form.
✨ All fields inside a <table> for perfect alignment.

🎯 What I Learned:
✅ Building forms using HTML5
✅ Using proper form input types like text, radio, checkbox, password, file, select, textarea
✅ Using attributes like required, placeholder, accept, autofocus
✅ Structuring complex layouts using <table>
✅ Creating user-friendly interfaces with grouping and labels

🛠️ Tools Used:
🧑‍💻 HTML5

🖥️ VS Code

🌐 Browser for testing (Chrome)

👨‍🎓 This form can be used in college admission systems, event registrations, or educational portals as a front-end layout before connecting to a backend like PHP/Java or databases like MySQL.
